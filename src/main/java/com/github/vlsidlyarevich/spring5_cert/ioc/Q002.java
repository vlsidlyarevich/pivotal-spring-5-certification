/**
 * <b>What is an interface and what are the advantages of making use of them in Java?</b>
 * <br><br>
 * In its most common form, an interface is a group of related methods with empty bodies.
 * They can describe behaviour of objects which are implementing them.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Why are they recommended for Spring beans?</b>
 * <br><br>
 * When Spring beans are implementing interfaces, it is very easy to change the application functionality.
 * You can simply exchange entire beans by changing the Spring configuration, but you donâ€™t have to make any changes to the code.
