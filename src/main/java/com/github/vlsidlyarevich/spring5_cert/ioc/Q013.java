/**
 * <b>What does component-scanning do?</b>
 * <br><br>
 * Component scanning automatically detects dependency candidates discovered by the classpath scanning.
 * During the scanning process, Spring searches for the classes annotated with the stereotype annotations.
 * Those annotations are {@code @Component}, {@code @Controller}, {@code @Service} and {@code @Repository}.
 * Classpath scanning, together with bean autowiring can replace the explicit XML configuration.
